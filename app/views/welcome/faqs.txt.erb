FAQs
1.What is autoEdit?
It’s a digital paper editing software. For those less familiar with it, a paper edit is a script made from a selection of lines from the transcriptions of interviews.

With autoEdit, you can analyse your transcripts and mark them with tags and create a paper edit,  that you can then export as an EDL. You can then open in the editing software of your choice to reconnect the corresponding video into a sequence, and finish working on your rough-cut assembly.

For the transcriptions, autoEdit, takes .sbv and .srt subtitles files, and the suggested workflow is to use YouTube semi-automated captioning, to get a first draft of the timecoded transcriptions, that you can then proofread. Google/YouTube is very accurate at putting timecodes at the end of sentences, which is one less thing to do.

2.How does it work?
Preparation

get your transcriptions done in .sbv or .srt subtitle file format, for instance using YouTube automated captions
In autoEdit

upload transcripts in autoEdit, with metadata info of corresponding video
search and filter, drag and drop your selections into a new paper edit
export as EDL
In editing software

open EDL in editing software of choice
continue editing your sequence
I don’t want to use YouTube captioning - can I still use autoEdit?
Yes, as long as you can get your transcriptions into .sbv or .srt files then you are good to go.

A tool we recommend for getting your transcriptions done in .sbv or .srt is Subtitle Edit.

Can the transcription only be .sbv or .srt subtitles files?
Yes, for now, but if you have transcriptions in formats other than .sbv or .srt we want to hear from you.

3.Which languages are supported?
If you use Google/YouTube captions, to generate semi-automated transcriptions then the languages supported are:

• English

• Dutch

• French

• German

• Italian

• Japanese

• Korean

• Portuguese

• Russian

• Spanish

See Google Automatic captions for more details, and an up to date list of languages.

Having said that, autoEdit itself is language-independent, as long as you can get an .sbv,.srt file of the transcriptions.

4.I am working with different languages, is there support for that?
At the moment there is a work around that can still save you a lot of time. You can use YouTube/Google automated captions to get the transcription in the language you want (if supported, see list, otherwise, there are alternative methods to get your transcriptions done in .sbv or .srt formats, using autoEdit).

Then you can use the google translator toolkit, to translate your .sbv/.srt file into the required language to get a semi automated translation.

The translation file can then be uploaded into autoEdit in .sbv/.srt format. After paper editing, you can then export the EDL and reconnect and the rough cut will be as accurate as the translations you have put in it.

You can then export the rough cut video sequence from your editing software as a video preview for proof checking.

There are ways in which autoEdit could support this, so if this is a feature you would be interested in please do get in touch.
